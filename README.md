# Video-Memorability-Predection-for-MediaEval-2018-using-Machine-Learning
MediaEval 2018 is a competition which took place at France, Sophia Antipolis and EURECOM in October 2018. This competition had various tasks and predicting media memorability is one among those. Memorability can be defined as how good or bad a person can remember any video after a specified period of time. This is a part of MediaEval 2018 Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation. I will be predicting the probability of video getting remembered based on the given set of pre-computed features.
