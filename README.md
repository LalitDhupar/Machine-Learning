# Video-Memorability-Predection-for-MediaEval-2018-using-Machine-Learning
MediaEval 2018 is a competition which took place at France, Sophia Antipolis and EURECOM in October 2018. This competition had various tasks and predicting media memorability is one among those. Memorability can be defined as how good or bad a person can remember any video after a specified period of time.

# Assignment
Predict short-term and long-term memorability scores using either the video features like C3D, HMP or semantic feature like the captions (text explaining the video content).

# Dataset
Datset of 6000 short soundless video clips along with video features like C3D, HMP and semantic features were provied. Ground truth of Short-term Memorability scores, Long-term memorability scores and number of annotations which represents the number of people participated in the experiment were given as part of the assignment. 

# Aproach
Captions, C3D and HMP features of the vidoes were used to train RNN model on these features individually.
